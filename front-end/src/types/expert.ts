 * ExpertAssignment Status States:
 *
 * 'active' - Expert is currently assigned and working on the conversation
 *   - assignedAt is set, unassignedAt is null
 *   - Expert can send messages, resolve the conversation, or unclaim it
 *   - Conversation.assignedExpertId = expertId, Conversation.status = 'active'
 *
 * 'unassigned' - Expert was assigned but then unclaimed the conversation
 *   - assignedAt and unassignedAt are both set
 *   - Conversation goes back to waiting status for another expert
 *   - Conversation.assignedExpertId = null, Conversation.status = 'waiting'
 *
 * 'resolved' - Expert successfully resolved the conversation
 *   - assignedAt and unassignedAt are both set
 *   - Conversation is closed and no longer needs expert attention
 *   - Conversation.status = 'resolved'
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. Conversation created → status: 'waiting', no expert assigned
 * 2. Expert claims it → ExpertAssignment created with status: 'active'
 * 3. Expert unclaims it → ExpertAssignment updated to status: 'unassigned'
 * 4. Expert resolves it → ExpertAssignment updated to status: 'resolved'
 *
 * This provides complete audit trail of expert involvement in each conversation.
